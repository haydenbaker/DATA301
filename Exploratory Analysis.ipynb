With any given area, you are also able to see the breakdown by year of the counts of the points. While this is helpful to see a general trend in the data, we may still want to see the yearly breakdown of the data as it relates to the entire distribution. We can accomplish this through use of an interactive legend, by which you may select any given year (or multiple)."

Another interesting note is that the yearly breakdowns are very similar in distribution. 2018 and 2017 do appear to be a little less variable than earlier years, but we are still able to say that year does not play a significant role in the data."
