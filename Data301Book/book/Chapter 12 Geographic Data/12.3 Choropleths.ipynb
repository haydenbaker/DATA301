    "# 12.3 Choropleths\n",
    "\n",
    "A **choropleth** is a map in which areas are colored according to some statistic of interest. Perhaps the most familiar example of a choropleth is the presidential election map, which shows the percentage in each county who voted for the Democratic or Republican candidate. In this graphic, the observational units are counties, and the statistic of interest is the percentage who voted for the Democratic (or Republican) candidate. \n",

For example, the [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-cart-boundary.html) maintains shapefiles for boundaries of states, counties, and congressional districts in the United States. Shapefiles for the countries of the world can be found [at this website](http://thematicmapping.org/downloads/world_borders.php).\n",
