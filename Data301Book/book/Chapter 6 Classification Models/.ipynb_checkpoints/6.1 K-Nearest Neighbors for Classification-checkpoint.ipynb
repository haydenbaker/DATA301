Instead of averaging the labels of the $k$ neighbors to obtain our prediction, we count up the number of occurrences of each category among the labels and take the most common one. It makes sense that we have to do something different because the label is now categorical instead of quantitative. This is yet another example of the general principle that was introduced in Chapter 1: the analysis changes depending on the variable type!"
