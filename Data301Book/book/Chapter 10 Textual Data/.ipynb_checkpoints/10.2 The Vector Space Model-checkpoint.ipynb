A better indicator of whether two documents are similar is if they share rare words. For example, the word \"subpoena\" might only appear in a few documents in a corpus, but the presence of that word in two documents is a strong indicator that the documents are similar, so we should give more weight to terms like it.\n",

Since we want words that appear in fewer documents to get more weight, we take the **inverse document frequency** (IDF).  We take the logarithm of IDF because the distribution of IDFs is heavily skewed to the right. (Remember the discussion about transforming data from Chapter 1.4.) So in the end, the formula for IDF is:\n",
