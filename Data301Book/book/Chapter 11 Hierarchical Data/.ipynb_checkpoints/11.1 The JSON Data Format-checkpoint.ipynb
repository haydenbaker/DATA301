    "# Chapter 11. Hierarchical Data\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of data in the real world is naturally hierarchical. For example, consider a data set of concert programs by the New York Philharmonic, one of the world's leading orchestras. Each program consists of one or more works of music and is performed at one or more concerts. Furthermore, each work of music may feature any number of soloists.\n",
    "\n",
    "How would we represent this information in a single `DataFrame`? If each row represents a single program, then we need one column for each concert that the program appeared in. This is wasteful because some programs may have only appeared in one concert. We still need to keep around $M$ \"concert\" columns, where $M$ is the maximum number of concerts that any program appeared in.\n",
    "\n",
    "|concert1    | concert2   | ... | concertM | work1 | work2 | ... | workN |\n",
    "|------------|------------|-----|----------|----------------|-------|-----|-------|\n",

    "| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we need one column for each work in the program. The number of \"work\" columns has to be equal to the maximum number of works on any program, even though most programs may have had far fewer works. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully, it is clear that a single `DataFrame` is an inefficient way to represent hierarchical data---and we haven't even tried to include information about the soloists who performed in each work. This chapter is about efficient ways to represent hierarchical data, like the New York Philharmonic data set described above."
