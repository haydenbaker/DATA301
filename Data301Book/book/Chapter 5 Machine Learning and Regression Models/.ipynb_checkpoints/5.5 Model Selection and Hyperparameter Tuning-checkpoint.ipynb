    "## $K$-Fold Cross Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we carried out cross validation by splitting the data into 2 halves, alternately using one half to train the model and the other to evaluate the model. In general, we can split the data into $k$ subsamples, alternately training the data on $k-1$ subsamples and evaluating the model on the $1$ remaining subsample, i.e., the validation set. This produces $k$ somewhat independent estimates of the test error. This procedure is known as **$k$-fold cross validation**. (Be careful not to confuse the $k$ in $k$-fold cross validation with the $k$ in $k$-nearest neighbors.) Therefore, the specific version of cross validation that we saw earlier is $2$-fold cross validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A schematic of $4$-fold cross validation is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](k-folds.png)\n",

    "## Cross Validation in Scikit-Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-Learn provides a function, `cross_val_score`, that will carry out all aspects of $k$-fold cross validation: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. split the data into $k$ subsamples\n",
    "2. combine the first $k-1$ subsamples into a training set and train the model\n",
    "3. evaluate the model predictions on the last ($k$th) held-out subsample\n",
    "4. repeat steps 2-3 $k$ times (i.e. $k$ \"folds\"), each time holding out a different one of the $k$ subsamples\n",
    "4. calculate $k$ \"scores\", one from each validation set\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one subtlety to keep in mind. Training a $k$-nearest neighbors model is not just about fitting the model; it also involves dummifying the categorical variables and scaling the variables. These preprocessing steps should be included in the cross-validation process. They cannot be done ahead of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we run $5$-fold cross validation. Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When subsamples 1-4 are used for training and subsample 5 for validation, the observations have to be standardized with respect to the mean and SD of subsamples 1-4.\n",
    "- When subsamples 2-5 are used for training and subsample 1 for validation, the observations have to be standardized with respect to the mean and SD of subsamples 2-5.\n",
    "- And so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "We cannot simply standardize all of the data once at the beginning and run cross validation on the standardized data. To do so would be allowing the model to peek at the validation set during training. That's because each training set would be standardized with respect to a mean and SD that is calculated from all data, including the validation set. To be completely above board, we should standardize each training set with respect to the mean and SD of just that training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, Scikit-Learn provides a `Pipeline` object that allows us to chain these preprocessing steps together with the model we want to fit."
