    "## Performance Metrics for Regression Models\n",

    "To evaluate the performance of a regression model, we compare the predicted labels from the model against the true labels. Since the labels are quantitative, it makes sense to look at the difference between each predicted label $\\hat y_i$ and the true label $y_i$. \n",
    "\n",
    "One way to make sense of these differences is to square each difference and average the squared differences. This measure of error is known as **mean squared error** (or **MSE**, for short):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\textrm{MSE} &= \\textrm{mean of } (y_i - \\hat y_i)^2.\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "MSE is difficult to interpret because its units are the square of the units of $y$. To make MSE more interpretable, it is common to take the _square root_ of the MSE to obtain the **root mean squared error** (or RMSE, for short):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\textrm{RMSE} &= \\sqrt{\\textrm{MSE}}.\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "The RMSE measures how off a \"typical\" prediction is. Notice that the reasoning above is exactly the same reasoning that we used in Chapter 1 when we defined the variance and the standard deviation.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ \n",

    "\\textrm{MAE} &= \\textrm{mean of } |y_i - \\hat y_i|.\n",
