    "# Conceptual Quiz Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of class on Thursday, March 14, there will be a 30-minute quiz on machine learning. This quiz will count for 25% of your Exam 2 grade. This quiz will cover machine learning concepts such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- regression vs. classification\n",
    "- training set vs. test set vs. validation set\n",
    "- scoring metrics for measuring the performance of a machine learning model (e.g., RMSE, accuracy, etc.)\n",
    "- $k$-nearest neighbors\n",
    "- ensemble methods\n",
    "- methods for text processing, such as bag of words and TF-IDF\n",
    "\n",
    "To prepare, make sure you are familiar with the concepts in Chapters 5, 6, and 10 of the textbook. You may be asked to read and understand code on the quiz, but you will not have to write any code. The quiz will be open-book, like the exams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of the kinds of questions I will ask are provided below."
